# AI-Powered Tutorial Q&A Chatbot

## Introduction

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using the Hugging Face GPT-2 model and Flask framework. The chatbot is designed to answer questions based on tutorial content. Initially, it focuses on providing answers related to Python programming, but the system is built to be easily expandable to include tutorials on other topics, such as Data Science, in the future.

The chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process user queries and generate human-like responses based on the tutorial data, providing a personalized and interactive learning experience.
